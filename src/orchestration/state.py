"""
This module defines the orchestration state and dynamic context logic for PolyScholar's LangGraph workflows.

- AppState: The central state container for all static inputs, dynamic artifacts, logs, and short-term memory.
- format_dynamic_block: Helper to render a readable summary of the current state for prompt construction.

All agent nodes should treat AppState as the single source of truth for runtime facts.
